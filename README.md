This is a Streamlit-based application designed to help users manage their food expiry dates efficiently. It allows users to upload a CSV file containing food items and their expiry dates, then processes the data to:

Identify items that are close to expiry
Cluster food items based on expiry dates using K-Means clustering
Provide recipe suggestions for items that are expiring soon
